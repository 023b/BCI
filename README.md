**BCI** is an ongoing, modular framework for developing and experimenting with Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. The project is designed to support signal acquisition, preprocessing, machine learning inference, and user interaction, making it suitable for both academic research and practical experimentation in the BCI domain.

> **Status**: In active development. Expect frequent updates and improvements.

## Features

* **Data Collection**: Tools to gather EEG and physiological signals.
* **Signal Processing**: Modules for filtering, feature extraction, and transformation.
* **Inference Engine**: ML components for classifying and interpreting brain signals.
* **Simulation**: Synthetic EEG data generators for testing and validation.
* **User Interface**: Dashboards for real-time monitoring and interaction.
* **Modular Design**: Each component is decoupled for easy extension or replacement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* pip
* (Recommended) Create a virtual environment

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/023b/BCI.git
cd BCI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
